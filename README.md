# Overview
As a software engineer, I am continuously striving to expand my knowledge and understanding of various programming languages. This project demonstrates my efforts to learn and implement a game using the Rust programming language. By developing a Connect Four game, I aimed to grasp Rust's syntax, memory management, and error handling mechanisms.

This software is a terminal-based Connect Four game where two players take turns dropping discs into a vertical grid. The objective is to connect four of one's own discs consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal. The game checks for valid moves, handles errors gracefully, and determines the winner or if the game ends in a draw.

The primary purpose of writing this software is to deepen my understanding of Rust, focusing on its unique features and benefits. Through this project, I explored Rust's enums, pattern matching, ownership, and borrowing concepts.

# Development Environment
To develop this software, I used the following tools:

Rust Compiler: For compiling the Rust code.
Cargo: Rust's package manager and build system.
Visual Studio Code: My preferred code editor with Rust extensions for enhanced development.
The programming language used is Rust, and no additional libraries were required for this project. Rust's standard library provided all the necessary functionality to build the game.

# Future Work
Here are some things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future:

-Add AI for a single-player mode.

-Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.

-Optimize the code for better performance.

-Add more comprehensive error handling and edge case management.

-Enhance the display for better visual appeal.

-Implement saving and loading of game states.

-Add more customization options for the game (e.g., board size, win conditions).
